# NodeJS SDK Custom Giver configuration example

In this example we will configure AppKit to use our own Giver, deploy sample contract to test this configuration,
send some funds to random address and check messages and transactions made by this operation. In the example we use
predeployed Evernode SE giver with its address, keys and ABI, but you can use any other giver by substituting these values
with your own.
