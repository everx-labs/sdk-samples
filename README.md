# TON Labs SDK Samples
In this repository you will find examples of using Javascript SDK.

`v0` folder contains examples that use SDK with major version 0, which is no longer supported.

`v1` folder contains examples working on the currently developed Javascript (Typescript) SDK with major version 1. We encorage you to use it in your projects.
