# Why you may need this repository?

- If you want to create your own DApp in Everscale, then SDK samples is a good place to start.
  You can start with the very simple [hello application](/demo/hello-wallet) in Node.js.
  Or explore a more complex [Web application imitating p2p exchange](/demo/web\_p2p\_exchange).

- Explore new features. 
  We constantly update the repository with samples that use new SDK features.   

To get a deeper understanding dive into [SDK guides](https://docs.everos.dev/ever-sdk/guides/work_with_contracts) where you can find extensive explanations and descriptions of each step of DApp development on Everscale.
