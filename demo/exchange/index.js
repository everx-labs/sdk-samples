/**
 *  In this example we demonstrate how to integrate Free TON into an exchange backend.
 *
 * It covers such use-cases as:
 *
 * - wallet deploy
 * - wallet deposit
 * - wallet withdraw
 * - sequential blockchain transactions reading
 * - sequential wallet transactions reading
 *
 * To run this sample you need to have a multisig wallet with positive balance, already deployed to the Developer Network.
 * Specify its private key and address at the launch. It will be used to pay for deploy operation.
 *
 * Read about multisig wallet here https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig
 *
 * To migrate from Developer Network to Free TON you need to update the endpoints specified in TonClient configuration to Free TON endpoints.
 *
 * See the list of supported networks and endpoints here https://docs.ton.dev/86757ecb2/p/85c869-networks
